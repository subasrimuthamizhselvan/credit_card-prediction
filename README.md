Credit Card Approval Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected based on financial and personal details. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle/UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes features like income, credit score, loan history, and employment status.

📌 Features
✅ Preprocesses data (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling)
✅ Trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
✅ Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
✅ Optimizes model for high accuracy (90%+)
✅ Visualizes feature importance & model performance

🚀 How It Works
Load Dataset: Reads and cleans credit approval data.
Data Preprocessing: Encodes categorical variables, scales numerical features.
Model Training: Compares multiple models and selects the best-performing one.
Prediction: Determines if a new application will be Approved (1) or Rejected (0).
Evaluation: Uses metrics like confusion matrix, precision-recall to assess performance.
